# Bread Music Player
A tiny web music player where you can import, play, and save songs.
## The Idea
You can import music (mp3, ogg, wav) from your music library, or simply import a folder.
After doing that, you can listen to that music in Bread Music Player.
You can create playlists too, and shuffle them.

The point for this was because I wanted a spotify-like web app, but with as much
customization as I wanted, to where you can even edit the font itself.
## Features
- it looks cool
- there is nothing else yet (i need someone to make the js for this)
## Things to Add
be able to import songs (mp3, ogg, and more)

be able to load recently played and generate "for you" songs from your music library

have a music library

have the player (pause, play, anything you can find in spotify)

settings and theming

mobile responsiveness (very important)
